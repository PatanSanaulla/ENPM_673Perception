**Instructions to execute: HOMEWORK_1**

**PROBLEM 2:**

To generate a curve using Least Square method: 
* In the CLI enter   >> python problem_2.py data_1
* Note: data_1 is the name of the csv file which contains the data of points given in terms of (x,y), which is passed as a parameter to     read the data.
* Output: A graph is generated with the given data being plotted with the best fit curve as per Least Square

To generate a curve using RANSAC method:
* In the CLI enter   >> python problem_2_ransac.py data_2
* Note: data_2 is the name of the csv file which contains the data of points given in terms of (x,y), which is passed as a parameter to     read the data. 
* Output: A graph is generated with the given data being plotted with the best fit curve as per RANSAC
  

**PROBLEM 3:**

To check the SVD for the given Matrix: 
* In the CLI enter   >> python problem_3.py
* Note: Matrix A in the code is defined as per the given problem. 
* Output: The respective matrices U, V and Sigma will be generated and a final Homograpy Matrix calculated is Printed.
